Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ally Kim.

I am a Computer and Information Technology masters student at University of Pennsylvania.

I enjoy analyzing/visualizing large data, developing beautiful websites and user interfaces, and learning new languages (I am currently exploring the world of Rust, functional programming, and D3.js)!
