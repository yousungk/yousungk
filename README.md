Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ally Kim.

I am a CS masters student at University of Pennsylvania and a full stack engineer with expertise in Python, Java, and C++. 

I enjoy analyzing/visualizing large data, developing beautiful websites and user interfaces, and learning new languages (I am currently exploring the world of Rust, functional programming, and D3.js)!
